            <p>
                I wrote the original Flyer in the 1980s on an IBM PC XT using
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal">Turbo Pascal.</a>
                With low resolution black and white graphics,
                it was much simpler than the current
                iteration of the game. Inspired by the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)">Asteroids</a> 
                arcade game by Atari, I wanted to program something
                that could demonstrate the simple Physics of traveling
                in space.

            <p>
                I wrote the second version of this game for the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS">Classic Mac OS</a>
                in 1990 using the Think C compiler. At the time I was experimenting with
                several software projects in my spare time
                and I thought
                it would be fun to recreate the game I wrote years earlier.
                Some creative programming was needed to support a decent framerate
                on the higher resolution screens of the Macintosh computers of the time.
                You can find the source code for this version of Flyer archived on 
                <a href="https://github.com/dwilliams-github/flyer">github</a>.

                Uncovering the original code for the second version Flyer
                recently inspired me to write a new one, this time for the
                modern Mac OS. I decided that an updated version of the game
                would be a fun way to learn the
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a>
                programming language, the 
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> development environment,
                and also to demonstrate that I have not forgotten how
                to code.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also figured it would be fun to formally publish
                an application on Apple's App Store, something I've
                never done before. Which is probably
                why you are here reading this.

            <p>
                I wrote the code for this game from scratch using the 
                SpriteKit starting project provided by Xcode.
                With the notable exception of the sound effects, 
                I also created all of the game assets, including the graphics
                and this web site.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can find the code on
                <a href="https://github.com/dwilliams-github/flyer-macos">github</a>.
                I have released it under an 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT License</a>, 
                so feel free to browse and borrow.

        <div class="header">An encouraging word</div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Some of the software
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit">libraries</a> 
                provided by Apple make
                writing beautiful looking sprite-based games shockingly easy.
                For those of you interesting in programming, the
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a>
                programming language is also
                <a href="https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/">very approachable</a>. 
                So, if you want to learn some
                programming and have a little fun in the process, I encourage
                you dive in and write a simple Mac OS or iPhone application.
