            Flyer is designed to simulate traveling in
            the vacuum of space. This means that once you apply
            some thrust in one direction, you travel at constant speed
            in that direction until you apply more thrust. There are no
            brakes. To stop, apply the appropriate amount of thrust 
            in the opposite direction you are traveling.
        </p>
        <p>
            The controls for movement are therefore very simple.
            You may spin left (counter clockwise), spin right
            (clockwise), or apply thrust. These actions start
            when the corresponding keyboard key is pressed down,
            and end with the key is released. With practice,
            navigation will become natural.
        </p>
        <p>
            To simulate the vastness of space, there are no walls or
            barriers in Flyer. Any object that moves off the screen
            will appear on the opposite side. This includes the player,
            the foes, and even missles.

        <p>
            Although fast and nimble, your ship is very fragile.
            Contact with any objection will lead to immediate destruction.
            To avoid this, either maneuver around objects, or use your
            missles to destroy objects before they hit you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your weapons are missles that launch at constant velocity
            in the direction you are facing. They are quite powerful,
            and will destroy any object they encounter. They only last
            a fixed amount of time, however, so your range is limited.
            Only up to eight missles may appear at the same time, so use
            them sparingly.
