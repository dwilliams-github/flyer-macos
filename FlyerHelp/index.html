    <h1>How to play Flyer</h1>
    <p>Your task is simple: shoot any object before it hits you.</p>
    <p>This is your ship:</p>
    <img src="shared/ship.png" width="64px"/>
    <p>You control your ship with four commands, which by default are linked to the following keys:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="shared/left-arrow-key.png" width="32px"/></td>
            <td>Spin counter-clockwise</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="shared/right-arrow-key.png" width="32px"/></td>
            <td>Spin clockwise</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="shared/up-arrow-key.png" width="32px"/></td>
            <td>Thrust</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="shared/z-key.png" width="32px"/></td>
            <td>Fire</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>You can also pause the game by pressing a fifth key, which by default is the space bar.
    <h2>Hints</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There is a limit to how many missles can be active at one time. Use them sparingly.</li>
        <li>When you first appear you are in a protected state until you move. You might want to wait a bit.</li>
        <li>Each type of object responds to your movements in a predictable way. Learn and adapt.</li>
        <li>If your are moving too fast, bad things could happen. Don't be reckless.</li>
    </ul>
